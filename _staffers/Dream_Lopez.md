Hello everyone!! Iâ€™m a second year planning to major in Data Science and Public Health. I took CS10 my first semester at Berkeley and it really helped my build confidence in my coding abilities! This is my third semester as an AI. In my free time I love to read, hike, watch movies, find cute coffee shops, and bake. I look forward to meeting everyone and help you fall in love with CS <3
