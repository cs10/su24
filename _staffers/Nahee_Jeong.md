Hi guys! Iâ€™m Nahee, a rising sophomore intending to study computer science. I was an Academic Intern for CS10 last semester, and this is my first time becoming a tutor. Outside of school, I love watching horror movies, writing short stories, and building cute mobile apps. Looking forward to getting to know you all!
